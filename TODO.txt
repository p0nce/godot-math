- orthonormalize, doesn't work?
 translate AABB
- translate Plane
- cast from Projection to Transform3D
- Rect shall have scaleByFactor method (as deprecated alias to scale_by_factor) same as in dplug:math
- from_euler with 3 T (???)
- from_scale avec 3 T (???)
- is_identity_approx / is_zero_approx for all things float
- Basis avec 9 nombres, attention col vs row
- Rect2 transform by Transform2D, direct and indirect
- Proper documentation that showcase matrix and vector basic math.
- all types should have .ptr
- all types should cast to similar instantiation
- not sure about assigning .top .left .right .bottom keeping the existing size...
